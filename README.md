Testing Excel's skills

This file was obtained from Luke Barousse who is an amazing data analytics tutor.
in this file I've followed everystep that he has made through out Power Pivot chapter, 
and I did actually gladfully follow him throughout all of the 11 hours of Excel course. 
 
I don't know how but this file may help newcomers in data analytics field in the future or even myself if I need to revise. 
This is the first project already learned alot of skills from functions like , MAX, MIN, XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, 
AVERAGE, IF, IFS, COUNT, SUM etc...

and doing tables, charts, pivot tables, using power query and lastly using power pivot and DAX. 
it is still amazing to now that all of these was just basics and yet the field is still wider demonstrating the importance and
width of data analytics field.  

 
If you are still reading this you either maybe so bored  to read this or maybe an amazing person who is ambitious and seeks 
to become an effecient person. 
Lastly, Thank you for reading this unnecessary text.
